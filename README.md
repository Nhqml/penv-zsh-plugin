penv-zsh-plugin
===============

ZSH plugin that provides the `penv` command for managing uv Python virtual environments stored in ~/.local/share/py-venv/<name>.
Supports subcommands for listing, activating (shell and directory level), creating, deleting and explaining why an env is activated.

I use it to replace pyenv + poetry with uv, without loosing some cool features.
